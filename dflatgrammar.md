According to Sebesta, a CFG representing a language must have a few traits:
  -Terminal Symbols
  -Nonterminal Symbols
  -Production Rules
  -Start Symbol!

Evan, if you want to change any of this, just do it! Really, the CFG won't matter too much right off the bat.
Just wanted to get started on the plex files :)

dflat -> lines
lines -> line | line . lines
line ->  var op numconst
var -> ??
op -> + | - | * | /
